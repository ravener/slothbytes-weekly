# Loves me, Loves me notâ€¦
# "Loves me, loves me not" is a traditional game in which a person plucks off all the petals of a flower one by one,
# saying the phrase "Loves me" and "Loves me not" when determining whether the one that they love, loves them back.
# Given a number of petals, return a string which repeats the phrases "Loves me" and "Loves me not" for every
# alternating petal, and return the last phrase in all caps. Remember to put a comma and space between phrases.
#
# Notes
#   Remember to return a string.
#   The first phrase is always "Loves me".
