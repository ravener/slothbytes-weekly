This repository hosts my solutions for the weekly challenges provided in the [SlothBytes Newsletter](https://slothbytes.beehiiv.com) ([Use my referral](https://slothbytes.beehiiv.com/subscribe?ref=zyCF0kM9m1))

They are pretty simple but are still a fun exercise to do, so I decided to keep doing them and made this repository to host all my solutions for easier organization and submission.
